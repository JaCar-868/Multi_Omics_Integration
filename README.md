# Multi-Omics Data Integration and Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project develops a machine learning framework to integrate and analyze multi-omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. By employing unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, the framework identifies patterns and correlations across different omics layers, providing insights into complex biological processes and disease mechanisms.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/multi-omics-integration.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd multi-omics-integration
   
3. Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Load data:
Place your omics data in the data/ directory.

2. Preprocess data:

python preprocess_data.py

3. Integrate data:

python integrate_data.py

4. Analyze and visualize results:

python analyze_data.py
