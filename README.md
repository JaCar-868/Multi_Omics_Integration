# Multi_Omics_Integration

## Project Description
This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify protein sequences. By leveraging a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, the model can effectively capture patterns in protein sequences to classify them into functional categories. This project demonstrates expertise in sequence analysis, which is crucial for understanding protein functions and interactions in biological research.
