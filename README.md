# Multi_Omics_Integration

## Project Description
This project develops a comprehensive machine learning framework to integrate and analyze multi-omics data, combining genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics datasets. By employing a combination of unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, the framework identifies patterns and correlations across different omics layers, providing insights into complex biological processes and disease mechanisms. This project showcases proficiency in handling large-scale, high-dimensional biological datasets.
